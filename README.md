A 'Name That Tune' game, using the new(ish) Spotify Web API.

To play, press start!

In each round, 9 songs will be chosen at random. Click on the track you hear playing to score points. The faster you guess, the more points you earn! But don't guess if you aren't sure, wrong answers aren't worth any points.

This song list is currently: 85 of the '1976 Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles'

To do:
  - Project description (and credits - spotify/requests/billboard/wiki?)
