## Name That Tune

A 'Name That Tune' game, using the Spotify Web API.

[Try it!](http://mattmattmattwhatwhat.github.io/music-games/)

### How to play

In each round, 9 songs will be chosen at random. Click on the track you hear playing to score points. The faster you guess, the more points you earn! But don't guess if you aren't sure, wrong answers aren't worth any points.

The game lasts 5 rounds, with a maximum score of 300 points for each guess.
